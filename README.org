* Read JustCommands and BasicCommands

The two files show a list of commonly used (and some of my personal favourite) commands for Kubernetes

BasicCommands is a set of very simple commands
JustCommands is a set of more advanced topics (plus some for just a bit of fun)

I will add more as feel appropriate and find they are of value
